# TörmentäLab - Stormcoding Manifesto.
(Movie Trailer Voice):
That's the storm before the code.
The beginning of stormcoding.
The birth of a "Fullstack Storyteller".

## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Umberto! I'm an Italian entertainment and advertising creative. 
Yeah, fuck my life!
I've used to work in the last 7 years as writer, story editor and producer in the Italian movie industry. 
Web advertising led me to impact IT's world. 
I dug deeper and now I'm sure:
Computer Science is the most powerful tool to enlarge a creative's horizon.
But mastering IT is hard. 
That's why i'm enrolling into an IT Engineering's bachelor at the age of 33 :-P.

## Why this repo?
I know i'm pursuing a hard goal.
It will need a lot of sacrifices, but I've already got a job and LOL I survived movie industry!
My programming skill start from scratch. 
I want to write repos to keep trace of my growth.
Repos help me to document a journey that excites but also scares me.
Every single basic step feels like a big challenge.
Sharing them is my attempt to learn by your experience.

## What's coming?
- Raw experiments in Python, Linux, SQL and beyond.
- Notes, trials, errors and learning in public. 
- A crossover between storytelling, creativity and technology.

## Why that name?
Törmentä means "storm".
You can't predict the storm, you can only tell where it passed.

The previous statement was for marketing.
"Törmentä" is because I'm messy like a freakin'storm.

But without it, it wouldn't be stormcoding.
